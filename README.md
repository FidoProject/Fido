# Creative Cloud for PlayOnLinux

**This script currently does not work, see [issue #52](https://github.com/corbindavenport/creative-cloud-linux/issues/52) for more details.**

This is an install script for [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html), designed to be used with [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com). The script sets up the Adobe Creative Cloud desktop program, which can be used to install and update Photoshop, Lightroom, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and other apps.

Only Photoshop CC, Bridge CC, Lightroom 5, and the Creative Cloud manager have been extensively tested. The newest Lightroom CC app is not supported right now. File syncing currently [does not work](https://github.com/corbindavenport/creative-cloud-linux/issues/29).

A (free) Adobe ID is required. Most Adobe applications require [a paid subscription](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html).

## How to use this script

1. Download PlayOnLinux from your distribution's package manager (e.g. Ubuntu Software Center) or from [the PlayOnLinux website](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html)
2. Save the [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/creative-cloud-linux/master/creativecloud.sh) to your computer
3. Open PlayOnLinux, go to Tools > Run a local script
4. Select the install script you just downloaded

After the setup process is finished, you can open `Adobe Creative Cloud` from PlayOnLinux to download and install the apps you need. After you download an app, you can add a PlayOnLinux shortcut for it by clicking Adobe Application Manager in the app list, clicking `Configure`, and clicking `Make a new shortcut from this virtual drive`. Then look for the app you need, like Photoshop.exe, and add it.

**Tip:** Tooltips in Photoshop might not disappear automatically. You can turn off tooltips completely by going to `Edit > Preferences > Tools` and un-checking the `Show tooltips` box.

If the installer crashes, see the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/corbindavenport/creative-cloud-linux/wiki/Troubleshooting). If you still have issues, try [the classic script](https://github.com/corbindavenport/creative-cloud-linux/tree/classic).
