# Fido

An open-source, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido includes implementations of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms. Fido is especially suited for robotic contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.

## Getting Started

The only dependency for the library is [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/learn.php). Please install this before proceeding.

Clone the github repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FidoProject/Fido.git
```

Move to the Software directory and build the library using cmake.
```
$ cd Fido/Software && make
```

Now you may use Fido in your C++ projects, by including any of the header files located in the Software directory.

## Example Code

An example of creating and training a neural network to perform linear regression.

```cpp
#include "Fido/Software/NeuralNet.h"
#include "Fido/Software/Backpropagation.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Creates a neural network with
  // 1 input, 1 output, 2 hidden layers, 4 neurons per hidden layer, and a sigmoid activation function.
  net::NeuralNet neuralNetwork = net::NeuralNet(1, 1, 2, 4, "sigmoid");
  std::vector< std::vector<double> > input = { {1}, {2}, {5}, {6} };
  std::vector< std::vector<double> > correctOutput = { {2}, {4}, {10}, {12} };

  // Create backpropagation object with
  // a learning rate of 10%, a momentum term of 0.001, an acceptable error level of 5%,
  // and a maximum number of training iterations of 10000
  net::Backpropagation backprop = net::Backpropagation(0.1, 0.001, 0.05, 10000);
  backprop.trainOnData(&neuralNetwork, input, correctOutput);

  // Cycle through inputs and print the outputs
  for (std::vector<double> current: input) {
      std::vector<double> final = neuralNetwork.getOutput(current);
      std::cout << "Correct answer: " << current[0] << "\tActual answer:" << final[0] << std::endl;
  }

  // Print the neuron weights
  neuralNetwork.printWeights();
}
```
