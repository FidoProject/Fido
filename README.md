Fido is an open-source, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido is especially suited for robotic and embedded contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.
