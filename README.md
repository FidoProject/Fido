Fido is an lightweight, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido is especially suited for robotic and embedded contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.

Check out the [project site](http://fidoproject.github.io/) and [documentation](http://fidoproject.github.io/docs/html/) for more information.

The library was adapted from [a universal robot control system](https://github.com/FidoProject/Research).
